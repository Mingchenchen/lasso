# lasso
A R implementation of Lasso regression

Algorithm: 

Lasso regression is performed via a modified version of Least Angle Regression (LAR), see ref[1] for the algorithm. The return value is a lassoClass object, where lassoClass is a S4 class defined in lassoClass.R. 

A test program is provided in lassoTest2.R,  in which the full lasso path is generated using data set provided in the lars package. 

Please contact the author if you would like to use the code in your work.
